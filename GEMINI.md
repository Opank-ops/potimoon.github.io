# GEMINI Analysis for Potimoon Website

## Directory Overview

This directory contains the source files for a simple, static, single-page website for **Potimoon**, a brand of natural cucumber juice (`Jus Timun`) from Banjarnegara. The website is designed to showcase the product, explain its benefits, and provide contact information for potential customers. The overall theme is fresh, natural, and healthy.

The user's original goal was to add a database to this site to handle purchases. This would require converting the project from a static site to a dynamic web application with a backend server and a database.

## Key Files

*   `Index.html`: This is the main and only functional page of the website. It serves as a landing page and includes several sections:
    *   A "hero" section with a call to action to order the product.
    *   A "product" section detailing the flagship product, "Jus Timun 'PureGreen'", including its price (Rp 12.000) and health benefits. It also has a placeholder for future products.
    *   A "mission" section outlining the company's goals (100% natural, health-focused, supporting local farmers).
    *   A "contact" section with a WhatsApp number and Instagram handle.

*   `tentang.html`: This file is likely intended to be an "About Us" page, as referenced in the navigation bar. However, the file appears to be corrupted or is not a valid text-based HTML file, so its content cannot be read.

*   `logo-potimoon.png`: The official logo for the Potimoon brand.

*   `produk-jus.jpeg`: A product image showcasing the cucumber juice.

## Usage

These files form a static website. To view or host it, you can:
1.  Open the `Index.html` file directly in a web browser.
2.  Place the entire folder contents onto a web server (like Nginx, Apache, or a static site hosting service).

To fulfill the user's request to add a purchase system, the following steps would be necessary:
*   Develop a backend application (e.g., using Node.js/Express).
*   Set up a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) to store orders.
*   Modify the frontend HTML and add JavaScript to send purchase requests from the browser to the new backend server.
